# Data-4-Dummies
Data science is hard. Like _really_ hard. We decided it didn't have to be. <br>

Data-4-Dummies is an easy-to-use web interface that allows you to upload your data and receive high & low-level insights without writing a single line of code. Imagine it as if Microsoft Excel Online and Python had an illicit love child. <br><br> Functionality is being added on a weekly basis, but some intended features include: 
* Data Preprocessing (Imputation, Null-Removal)
* High-level Overviews (Descriptions of Data & Columns)
* Basic Predictive Analysis (Based on user-selected features)
* Basic Feature Engineering
